			<p id="with-element"> <b> SYRACUSE, N.Y.</b> ‚Äì It‚Äòs a good news just before the Christmas that national gas oil finally decreased. It's not only a relief to local citizen, but also to local airport transportation services.
      </p>

			<p>Surging crude oil prices are contributing to an increase in the cost of gasoline. As drivers contend with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-prices-record-5-per-gallon-united-states">$5</a> a gallon gasoline prices nationwide, the cost of fueling aircraft is also rising.But with the decrease in oil price nowadays, the local citizen may relieved than previous.</p>

       <p>In the Year of 2022 at month <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nisk4KaxYkJib2eQMRkQQ6QR_ILd6y3b0oHdPI8kYRc/edit#gid=1606344655">September</a>, the driver in Syracuse need to spend $0.11 more per gallon than the  driver in  New York City.If a car tank is 14.5 gallon, that means a driver need to spend $1.63  more in Syracuse than in New York at the month of September in year of 2022.</p>
			
       <p> According to <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/charts">GasBuddy</a>, U.S. national average gasoline prices declined to $3.403 per gallon on Dec.5th.</p>

       <p>At the Year of 2022,  four major population cities in NewYork State: NewYork City; Syracuse; Rochester; Utica at both Month September and October are all above  $3.5. Especially in September, the average of gas price in Syracuse is 3.97 ($/gal), a number near 4.00 $/gal.</p>

        <p> And this created a lot of painful in local people's daily budget, but now, it's a final relief for them.</p>

			<h3>Why There Is A Decrease In Gas Price</h3>

			<p> <a href="https://info.westerncentralny.aaa.com/news-room/aaa-announces-new-communications-specialist-0">Valerie Puma</a>, a communications specialist at the Automobile Association of America (AAA) said the national average of regular gasoline has been on the decline for the past month, as the demand for gasoline steadied and the total domestic gasoline stock increased. </p>

			<p><i>‚ÄúMore fuel and less demand helped to push pump prices lower,‚Äù</i> Puma said. <i>‚ÄúGiving motorists some much needed relief after a year of high gas prices.‚Äù</i></p>

			 <p>Puma thought supply and demand is always a really big variable. The less demand on fuel made a decrease in local gas price first. That's why Syracuse citizen can see a decrease after June. </p>

			  <p><i> "So when people were entering the fall season, they were using the winter blend, which is a little bit cheaper, and fewer people are traveling just because students have gone back to school."</i> Puma said.<i>"People weren't taking as many vacations in October, they might be traveling a little bit, but they might be staying closer to home so they don't have to gas up as often."</i></p>

</script>

		</section>
       <p>According to Puma, as demand remains low and stocks grow, drivers could continue to see prices at gas stations go down.</p>

        <p><i>‚ÄúStates will always vary their average prices, based on variables such as their proximity to the nearest refinery and their delivery fees, gas taxes, and more.‚Äù</i> Puma said.</p>

         <p>From Puma, the national average of regular gasoline is currently around $3.40, down nearly 40 cents compared to the beginning of November.Also, the New York state average of regular gasoline is currently around $3.70, down about 16 cents compared to the beginning of November</p>

         <p>Puma said it can be seen some political element cause the falling in gas price but that's not caused by Midterm Election.</p>


         <p> <i>"The gas price decrease began even before the midterm election, mostly due to increasing domestic gasoline stocks and the lower demand for gasoline as motorists wrapped up their summer travel and began staying home this fall."</i> Puma continued.</p>

         <p> According to Puma, <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/state-gas-price-averages/">AAA</a> predicted the small rise in crude oil prices will not interrupt the decline in gasoline prices we are seeing in the United States.</p>

         <p><i> ‚ÄúU.S. gas prices in 2023 will be sharply below 2022 numbers, with a national average staying below $4 per gallon.‚Äù</i> Puma said.</p>

			<h3>Low Gas Price Can Also Relief The Pressure In NationWide Airport</h3>

			<p id="with-element"> Due to the fall in gas price, Officials at the <a href="https://syrairport.org/">Syracuse Hancock  International airport</a> said they do not need to adjust their budget this year.</p>

			
			<p id="with-element"><i>‚ÄúEvery year we do an estimate of how expensive it‚Äôs going to be to do a variety of things at the airport, whether that‚Äôs mowing the lawn, whether that‚Äôs clearing snow; and if gas prices are going up, we have to increase that budget, and we have to find the money within our overall airport system,‚Äù</i> said <a href="https://twitter.com/mattsnowmancny">Matthew Szwejbka</a>, communications specialist at Syracuse Hancock International Airport.</p>

      <p id="with-element">However, compared to <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/AverageFare/">airfare prices</a> six months ago, there has been a deduction in each airline ticket sold at Syracuse Hancock. The reason: gasoline prices leveled or dropped,  both in the Syracuse area and nationwide.</p>


      <p id="with-element">At the same time,the price of <a href="https://syrairport.org/parking-transportation/public-transportation/">Syracuse Hancock public ground vehicle services</a> seems also in a decrease trend. </p>

      <p id="with-element"><i>‚ÄúCompared to last year, the average fare of public transportation services to has beetle airport decreased two to five dollars,‚Äù</i>Szwejbka said. <i>‚ÄúA relief for most Central New Yorkers since Syracuse Hancock is the first airport choice for most of them.‚Äù</i></p>


      <p id="with-element">Officials at the airport will keep a wary eye on gas prices. If they were to go up again, that will burden airport services especially ground vehicle services.And the result of higher costs to the airport would directly impact the ticket prices over time.</p>


       <p id="with-element"><i>‚ÄúIf the cost to keep the airfield clear, both for mowing and for snow plowing purposes, if those costs go up, those costs do get passed along to the airlines as they operate at our airport,‚Äù</i> Szwejbka said.</p>

       <p id="with-element"><i>‚ÄúAs gas prices start to slowly go back up again, that does increase our costs,‚Äù</i> Szwejbka said. <i>‚ÄúFor example, for the vehicles that we own. Our snow plows you see out here clearing the snow field, the tractors used to mow the lawn, that would cost more.‚Äù</i></p>

			<h3>Gas Price Future Prediction</h3>

			<p>From Puma, <a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/">the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)</a> and allies including Russia ‚Äîcalled ‚ÄúOPEC+‚Äù ‚Äî agreed to stick to their previous plan to cut crude oil output by two million barrels per day through 2023. </p>

			<p>This comes after the Group of Seven (G7) countries, Australia, and 27 European Union countries agreed on a $60-a-barrel price cap on seaborne Russian oil, in an effort to reduce Moscow‚Äôs ability to finance its war in Ukraine and preserve stability on the global oil market.</p>


     <p>However, AAA and its partner <a href="https://www.opisnet.com/">OPIS</a> , the Oil Price Information Service, expected that the small rise in crude oil prices would not interrupt the decline in gasoline prices we are seeing in the United States.</p>

     <p><i>‚ÄúDeflation for diesel and jet fuel prices may not come until next spring.‚Äù</i> Puma said.</p>
